# Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Trading System to Render.com for free, giving you a public URL like `https://trading-system.onrender.com`.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

First, push your code to GitHub:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create a new repository on GitHub and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trading-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Render.com

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. Click "New +" and select "Blueprint"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select the repository you just created
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and set up your service
6. Click "Apply" to start the deployment

### 3. Access Your Deployed App

After deployment completes (usually takes 5-10 minutes for the first deploy):

1. Go to the Render dashboard
2. Click on your "trading-system" service
3. You'll see a URL like `https://trading-system.onrender.com`
4. That's your public URL! Share it with anyone to access your trading system

## Alternative Cloud Platforms

If you prefer other platforms, here are some alternatives:

### Heroku

1. Create a `Procfile` with:
   ```
   web: gunicorn web_app:app
   ```
2. Deploy using the Heroku CLI:
   ```
   heroku create trading-system
   git push heroku main
   ```

### PythonAnywhere

2. Upload your code or clone from GitHub
3. Set up a web app with Flask

### Railway

1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Railway will automatically detect your Flask app

## Maintaining Your Cloud Deployment
