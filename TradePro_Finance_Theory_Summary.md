# TradePro: Financial Theory Summary

## Core Financial Theory

TradePro is built on key financial ideas that guide how it trades and manages risk across multiple asset classes including stocks, the Nifty index, and commodities. At its heart, the system uses portfolio theory to balance risk and reward when selecting investments. By looking at how different assets performed in the past and how they move in relation to each other, TradePro builds portfolios that try to get the best returns for a given level of risk. The system analyzes each asset's risk level (how much it moves with the market) to decide if it's worth investing in, with special attention to how commodities like gold, silver, and crude oil often move differently from stock markets, providing valuable diversification.

The system uses two main approaches to decide when to buy and sell. First, it uses technical analysis - looking at price charts and patterns to spot buying and selling opportunities. Tools like RSI (which shows if a stock is overbought or oversold), MACD (which tracks momentum), and Bollinger Bands (which show when prices might be too high or too low) help identify good times to trade. These techniques work well for both stock indices like Nifty and commodities markets, though with different sensitivity settings for each market type. Second, TradePro uses smart computer models (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM, and Random Forest) that can find hidden patterns in market data. These models break down price movements into trends, seasonal patterns, and random movements to make better predictions than just looking at charts. The models are specially tuned to capture the unique seasonal patterns often seen in commodities and the correlation between Nifty movements and global market trends. By combining these different approaches, TradePro gets more reliable trading signals across all asset classes.

Risk management is a big part of TradePro, with several layers of protection. For position sizing (how much to invest in each trade), it uses the Kelly formula, which calculates the best amount to invest based on your edge and win rate. Stop-losses (automatic sell points) adjust based on market volatility rather than being fixed, so they adapt to changing market conditions - particularly important for commodities which can be more volatile than stocks. At the portfolio level, TradePro limits how much you can lose overall, avoids putting too much money in related assets, and prevents overconcentration in any one sector or asset class. This means balancing exposure between stocks, Nifty index derivatives, and various commodities to reduce overall portfolio risk. The system also tracks important risk measures like how much you could lose in a bad day (Value at Risk), how well you're being rewarded for the risk you're taking (Sharpe ratio), and your biggest drawdown (largest drop from peak to bottom). This careful approach to risk helps protect your money while still aiming for good returns across diverse market conditions.
