## Running the System 24/7

The Trading Strategy System is designed to run continuously using Docker containers.

### Starting the System on Arch Linux

```bash
# Make sure Docker service is running
sudo systemctl start docker

# Navigate to the project directory
cd trading-strategy-system

# Start the system using the provided script
./scripts/start_website.sh

# Alternatively, start manually
docker-compose up -d
```

### Checking System Status

```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Check Docker service status
systemctl status docker
```

### Stopping the System

```bash
# Stop the system
docker-compose down

# If you want to stop the Docker service as well
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

### Setting Up Automatic Start on Boot (Arch Linux)

To ensure the trading system starts automatically when your Arch Linux system boots:

```bash
# Enable Docker service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Create a systemd service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/trading-system.service
```

Add the following content to the service file:

```
[Unit]
Description=Trading Strategy System
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/trading-strategy-system
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-compose up -d
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker-compose down

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable trading-system.service
sudo systemctl start trading-system.service
```

## Management Tools

The Trading Strategy System comes with several tools to help you manage the 24/7 website.

### Command-Line Management Tool

The `manage_website.py` script provides a convenient way to manage the system from the command line:

```bash
# Check system status
python scripts/manage_website.py status

# Start the system
python scripts/manage_website.py start

# Stop the system
python scripts/manage_website.py stop

# Restart the system
python scripts/manage_website.py restart

# View logs (last 50 lines by default)
python scripts/manage_website.py logs
python scripts/manage_website.py logs --lines 100

# Backup data
python scripts/manage_website.py backup

# Update the system
python scripts/manage_website.py update
```

### Automated Monitoring

The `monitor_website.sh` script automatically checks if the website is running and restarts it if needed:

```bash
# Run the monitoring script manually
./scripts/monitor_website.sh

# Set up automatic monitoring (the script will configure this for you)
# It will create a cron job to check the website every 5 minutes
```

### System Service

For a more robust solution, you can install the system as a systemd service:

```bash
# Install the service (requires root privileges)
sudo ./scripts/install_service.sh

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable trading-system.service
sudo systemctl start trading-system.service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Web interface not accessible**
   - Check if Docker containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
   - Verify Docker service is running: `systemctl status docker`
   - Ensure port 8501 is open: `ss -tuln | grep 8501`
   - Check the system status dashboard: `http://localhost:8501/system`

2. **Data not updating**
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify API access
   - Refresh the page
   - Restart the specific service: `docker-compose restart trading-app`

3. **Trading errors**
   - Check account balance
   - Verify broker connectivity
   - Review error logs: `docker-compose logs trading-app`
   - Check the system status dashboard for service health

4. **Docker-related issues**
   - Clear Docker cache: `docker system prune`
   - Rebuild containers: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
   - Check Docker logs: `journalctl -u docker`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:

1. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
2. Review the error messages in the web interface
3. Use the System Status Dashboard to diagnose issues
4. Run the monitoring script: `./scripts/monitor_website.sh`
5. Contact system administrator for assistance

## Advanced Features

### Automated Trading

The system supports automated trading based on your configured strategy:

1. Configure your strategy parameters
2. Set risk management rules
3. Enable automated trading in the Trading Interface
4. Monitor performance in real-time

### Custom Strategies

You can develop custom trading strategies by:

1. Creating new strategy modules in `src/strategy/`
2. Implementing signal generation logic
3. Registering the strategy in the system
4. Testing with backtesting before live deployment

## Security Considerations

- Always use strong passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication for broker accounts
- Regularly review transaction history
- Set appropriate risk limits
- Never share your credentials

## Updates and Maintenance

The system is designed for continuous operation, but periodic maintenance is recommended:

1. Update dependencies: `docker-compose build --pull`
2. Restart the system: `docker-compose restart`
3. Check for system updates regularly
